I met a Traveller[n] from an antique[a] land[n] 
Who said: “Two vast[a] and trunkless[a] legs[n] of stone 
Stand in the desart[a]. Near them, on the sand[n], 
Half sunk, a shattered[a] visage lies, whose frown[v], 
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold[a] command[n], 
Tell that its sculptor[n] well those passions read 
Which yet survive[v], stamped on these lifeless[a] things, 
The hand[n] that mocked[v] them, and the heart that fed: 
And on the pedestal[n] these words appear: 
“My name is Ozymandias[n], King[n] of Kings[n].” 
Look on my works ye Mighty[n], and despair[v]! 
No thing beside remains. Round the decay 
Of that Colossal Wreck, boundless and bare 
The lone and level sands[n] stretch far away.
